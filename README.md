# Dual-task walking
When walking, people commonly perform multiple tasks at once. Walking is a complex and learned task. Single-task walking is when someone performs one task at a time (e.g., walking straight). Dual-task walking is walking while performing a cognitive task, like recalling names or counting, that is commonly performed during daily activities. Difficulty performing dual-task walking may lead to decreased mobility and an increased risk of falls, especially in older adults. A decline in mobility can lead to increased mortality and burden on society and caregivers. Dual-task walking can be easily observed and monitored during clinical and daily tasks to assess for changes in mobility. It is important for clinicians, specifically physicians, physical therapists, and occupational therapists, to understand the expected changes that occur during dual-task walking in healthy adults.


# Clinical Measures of Walking
Some methods of measuring walking in the clinic and laboratory settings include: visual observation, timing with a stopwatch, instrumented walkways, inertial sensors, and motion capture. All these measurements allow a person to assess the performance and quality of the movement with varying degrees of instrumented measurements. 

A simple measure for dual-task walking is the "Stops Walking While Talking" Test which simply assesses if a person can walk and talk simultaneously. If they are unable to perform this, then the person is challenged by performing dual-task walking. 

Using a stopwatch to measure changes in walking speed during single-task and dual-task walking is another way to measure overall change in walking with a dual-task. This can easily be performed by a clinician, using a defined walking length. 

Laboratory measures of walking, including instrumented walkways, inertial sensors, and motion capture, can give further information about changes that occur from single-task to dual-task walking. These tools allow for the a deeper assessment of the quality of the movement by using defined spatiotemporal measures.

# Dual-task walking
When walking, people commonly perform multiple tasks at once. Walking is a complex and learned task. Single-task walking is when someone performs one task at a time (e.g., walking straight). Dual-task walking is walking while performing a cognitive task, like recalling names or counting, that is commonly performed during daily activities. Difficulty performing dual-task walking may lead to decreased mobility and an increased risk of falls, especially in older adults. A decline in mobility can lead to increased mortality and burden on society and caregivers. Dual-task walking can be easily observed and monitored during clinical and daily tasks to assess for changes in mobility. It is important for clinicians, specifically physicians, physical therapists, and occupational therapists, to understand the expected changes that occur during dual-task walking in healthy adults.

Examples of dual-tasks include:
- Walking with counting
- Answering questions while cooking or following a recipe
- Memorizing a list of words while walking or driving
- Reciting items needed for an event while walking or cleaning the house
- Following directions while driving
- Navigating the grocery store while shopping. 


## Clinical Measures of Walking
Some methods of measuring walking in the clinic and laboratory settings include: visual observation, timing with a stopwatch, instrumented walkways, inertial sensors, and motion capture. All these measurements allow a person to assess the performance and quality of the movement with varying degrees of instrumented measurements. 

A simple measure for dual-task walking is the "Stops Walking While Talking" Test which simply assesses if a person can walk and talk simultaneously. If they are unable to perform this, then the person is challenged by performing dual-task walking. 

Using a stopwatch to measure changes in walking speed during single-task and dual-task walking is another way to measure overall change in walking with a dual-task. A clinician can easily perform this using a defined walking length. 

Laboratory measures of walking, including instrumented walkways, inertial sensors, and motion capture, can give further information about changes that occur from single-task to dual-task walking. These tools allow for a deeper assessment of the quality of the movement by using defined spatiotemporal measures. 

Spatiotemporal measures include measures of distance and time, specifically those associated with foot stepping patterns (e.g., step length, gait speed) and the time spent in the gait cycle (e.g., double limb stance, swing time). Spatiotemporal measures are often organized into gait domains to assist with selecting and interpreting gait metrics. These include the pace, rhythm, variability, postural control, phases, and asymmetry domains. 

Commonly used spatiotemporal measures used to measure dual-task gait and associated domains include: ## potential for visualization here?
- Gait Speed (m/s): the speed of walking, pace domain
- Step Length (m): The length from one heel strike the the next heel strike, pace domain
- Step Time (s): the time it takes to move from one heel stride to the next heel strike, rhythm domain
- Step Width (m): the width between one foot to midline, postural control domain
- Step Width Variability (SD, m): the standard deviation of step width demonstrating the fluctuation of variables, variability domain.

Motion capture technology is commonly used to perform gait assessment in a laboratory setting. This allows for a comprehensive view of gait. Motion capture uses multiple infrared cameras and r to collect three-dimensional marker positions and represent the anatomical body and joint positions during dynamic movement, including walking.

## Cognitive tasks 

Dual-task walking entails both cognitive and physical tasks. When challenging dual-task pathways, there are several cognitive tasks to consider. 

Some common cognitive tasks include:
- Serial 3s and 7s: counting backward from a number by 3s or 7s
- Naming animals or objects
- Reciting a list of words
- Answering questions

It is important to also consider the performance of the cognitive task during dual-task activities. People with cognitive impairment or other conditions may continue to perform the walking or physical task well but struggle to perform the cognitive task well when given a dual-task activity. 

# Clinical Relevance

Generally, older adults perform dual-task walking slower with a wider step width, longer step time, and shorter step length. However, the performance of cognitive tasks is not significantly different. If someone has cognitive impairment, they demonstrate worsening performance of cognitive tasks with relatively similar declines in physical function while performing dual-task walking.

- add in video graph (showing speed differences between ST/DT)
- add in graphs for spatiotemporal variables (change in gait velocity, step length, step width, stance time, correct response rate)
- add in kinematics if we get

## Dual-task training

When assessing and training dual-task walking, key considerations include:
- People generally walk slower with a wider step width, longer step time, and shorter step length during dual-task walking.
- Quantifying the performance of cognitive tasks may be important to potentially stress cognitive pathways, especially for people with cognitive changes.
- Dual-task walking is frequently performed during daily activities and can be a cause of falls or limited mobility.
- Adding dual-task assessment and training can help improve daily physical and cognitive function and potentially predict people who are at risk for cognitive decline.
